## MaxHeap Class

**File:** `max_heap.py`

This script implements a MaxHeap class with support for the following operations:
- Insert
- Delete
- Get Max

## URL Downloader with Retry

**File:** `download_urls.py`

This script defines a function to download content from a list of URLs with up to 3 retries in case of errors.

## Linear Regression with scikit-learn

**File:** `linear_regression.py`

This script trains a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn on a sample dataset. It includes splitting the dataset into training and testing sets and evaluating the model's performance.

## Data Preprocessing with pandas

**File:** `data_preprocessing.py`

This script defines a function to clean and preprocess a given DataFrame. It handles missing values, normalizes numerical columns, and encodes categorical columns.

## Fibonacci Number using Recursion

**File:** `fibonacci.py`

This script defines a function to compute the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

## Division with Custom Error Handling

**File:** `divide.py`

This script defines a function that divides two numbers and handles the case where the divisor is zero by returning a custom error message.

## Execution Time Decorator

**File:** `execution_time.py`

This script defines a Python decorator that measures the execution time of a function and logs it. It is applied to a function that performs a computationally expensive task.

## Arithmetic Operation Function

**File:** `arithmetic_operations.py`

This script defines a function that takes two numbers and an operator (as a string) and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

## Random Password Generator

**File:** `random_password.py`

This script defines a function that generates a random password. The password contains a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## Transpose of a Matrix

**File:** `matrix_transpose.py`

This script defines a function that takes a 2D list (matrix) and returns its transpose.

## Running the Scripts

To run any of the scripts, simply execute the corresponding Python file. For example:

```sh
python max_heap.py
